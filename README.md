# AI-Virtual-mouse

The AI Virtual Mouse is a computer visionâ€“based system that allows users to control the computer cursor using hand gestures instead of a physical mouse.
It uses a webcam to capture hand movements, processes them using AI and image recognition, and maps those gestures to mouse functions like move, click, drag, scroll, etc.
